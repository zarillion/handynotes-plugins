**A [HandyNotes](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/handynotes) plugin for the Dragonflight expansion. It will add the locations and rewards for rare mobs, battle pets, treasures and other miscellaneous points of interest to the map.**

## Global Features

### Rare Mobs

Rare mobs are listed as skulls on your map. If the skull is blue colored, that means you still need a collectible reward from that rare. If the rare has multiple spawn points, shares a spawn with common mobs or has a path, hovering over the skull will indicate all the points of interest or paths. Left-clicking on the skull will stick the points of interested on the map and minimap as you travel.

### Treasures & Collectibles

Locations and solutions for treasures are displayed on the map, along with the achievement they are associated with and any rewards they contain. Each treasure icon will disappear once it has been looted. The locations of mounts, pets and other collectibles found in the open world are also noted.

### Battle Pets and Trainers

The locations of all pet trainers and creature battles are marked on the map. Any achievements associated with defeating that creature or trainer will appear in the tooltip.

### Waypoints

Right-clicking a node to bring up its context menu. From this menu you can:

* Create a Blizzard or TomTom waypoint
* Hide this node or restore all hidden nodes

### Quick Toggle Menu

In addition to the plugin settings menu found under *Interface > Addons > HandyNotes*, a quick toggle menu will appear on any map that contains nodes added by this plugin. This allows you to quickly toggle, resize or change the opacity of nodes displayed on the current map.

### Options

* Change icon sizes and alpha based on type (rares, treasures, battle pets, etc)
* Customize the size and color and POIs and paths.
* Enable or disable groups of icons
* Enlarge icons when the world map is maximized
* Show only rares that you still need rewards from
* Show already completed nodes
