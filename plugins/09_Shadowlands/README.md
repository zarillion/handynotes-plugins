**A [HandyNotes](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/handynotes) plugin for the Shadowlands expansion. It will add the locations and rewards for rare mobs, battle pets, treasures and other miscellaneous points of interest to the map.**

![](https://www.tmdmguild.com/public/images/addons/shadowlands/banner.png)

## Rare Mobs

Rare mobs are listed as skulls on your map. If the skull is blue colored, that means you still need a collectible reward from that rare. If the rare has multiple spawn points, shares a spawn with common mobs or has a path, hovering over the skull will indicate all the points of interest or paths. Left-clicking on the skull will stick the points of interested on the map and minimap as you fly around.

## Treasures

Locations and solutions for treasures are displayed on the map, along with the achievement they are associated with and any rewards they contain. Each treasure icon will disappear once it has been looted.

## Pet Battles

All pet battle trainer locations are marked on the map with the familiar paw icon. They also show your progress in completing their respective world quests for the [Battle in Shadowlands](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/achievement=14625/battle-in-shadowlands) achievement.

## Bastion - Lost Anima Shards

Hidden all over Bastion (and inside its dungeons) are 50 Lost Anima Shards that can be collected for the [Shard Labor](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/achievement=14339/shard-labor) achievement. This achievement allows you to reforge the hammer needed to ring the [Vesper of the Silver Wind](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/object=355435/vesper-of-the-silver-wind) and obtain the [Silverwind Larion](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/item=180772/silverwind-larion) mount!

Each shard includes a short note describing its location.

## Maldraxxus - Pool of Mixed Monstrosities

In Maldraxxus you will find a pool in which you can toss oozes, goos and oils as ingredients. Different rares will spawn depending on the combination used. The tooltip for this pool describes all the possible combinations, where to get the ingredients and your current loot and achievement status for each rare.

## Maldraxxus - Slime Cats

The locations of all nine cats you must pet for the [Nine Afterlives](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/achievement=14634/nine-afterlives) achievement are displayed with instructions on how to reach them. Each cat icon will disappear once you have pet the cat.

## Revendreth - Carriages

The paths of all rideable carriages are mapped for the Revendreth zone. Hop in to drop combat and ride past all hostile mobs. Riding each carriage also gives credit towards [The Afterlife Express](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/achievement=14771/the-afterlife-express) achievement.

## Revendreth - Sinrunner Blanchy and the Loyal Gorger

The [Sinrunner Blanchy](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/item=182614/blanchys-reins) and [Loyal Gorger](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/item=182589/loyal-gorger) mounts both require you to perform tasks over several days. The addon will keep track of your progress and display how far along you are in their tooltips.

The Loyal Gorger icon will only appear once you have looted the [Impressionable Gorger Spawn](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/item=180583/impressionable-gorger-spawn) from the [Worldedge Gorger](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/npc=160821/worldedge-gorger) rare.

## The Maw - Event Locations

Daily bonus bosses and events in the maw which grant extra [Stygia](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/currency=1767/stygia) are marked on the map with red and yellow pins respectively.

![](https://www.tmdmguild.com/public/images/addons/shadowlands/maw_events.png)

These bosses differ from regular rares in the zone, which are marked with the usual skull icons.

## The Maw - Chaotic Riftstones

A handful of [Chaotic Riftstones](https://shadowlands.wowhead.com/search?q=Chaotic+Riftstone) can be found in the maw that will quickly transport you across the map. Their locations and paths have been marked so you can make efficient use of them!

![](https://www.tmdmguild.com/public/images/addons/shadowlands/chaotic_riftstones.png)

## Quick Toggle Menu

In addition to the plugin settings menu found under *Interface > Addons > HandyNotes*, a quick toggle menu will appear on any map that contains nodes added by this plugin. This allows you to quickly toggle, resize or change the opacity of nodes displayed on the current map.
