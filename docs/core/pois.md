## POI
Base class for other POI Classes.
POIs are only displayed when hovering a node.

```lua
POI({41176055, 41526214, 41995819, 43565838})
POI({color = 'Green', 41176055, 41526214}) -- this also works, but is not recommended
POI({color = 'Red', points = {41176055, 41526214, 41995819, 43565838}})
```

A POI can have just a table of coordinates, those will be marked by a dot. The color is by default blue and can be changed by the user through the settings.
POIs can also have following properties:

### Required Properties
`ns.poi.POI` requires the following properties:

* `points` ([int]) (*required*)
  * POI coordinates in a table.

### Optional Properties

* `color` ([color](colors.html))
  * Can use all colors set in [colors.lua](colors.html).
* `icon` ([string](icons.html))
  * Changes the dot to an [icon](icons.html).
* `quest` (int / [int])
  * Hides the POI if all quests are completed.
