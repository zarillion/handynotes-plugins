To update the `*.blp` files using Photoshop, download the following:

    https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/photoshop-blp-format-plugin
    https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info14110-BLPConverter.html

When saving to BLP, use DXT5 compression. If the Photoshop plugin breaks and doesn't want to save the file, save as PNG instead and use the converter program:

    ./BLPConverter.exe /UPNG_RGBA=BLP_DXT5 icons.png
